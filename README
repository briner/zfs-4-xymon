zfs-4-xymon packages was mainly created to get a better monitoring of zpool and zfs within xymon.
With zfs comes difficulties to know which zfs get bigger within a zpool. This scripts extracts such informations and bring it to xymon. Furthermore, it can also display the same informations in the terminal.

e.g.
/usr/local/hobbit/client/ext/zfs-list-detail 
  # zpool status -xv :all pools are healthy
  # 
  # name                                         size     used      used_2    avail    cap cap_2  health

as you can see we have added new columns named used_2 and cap_2. If you sum up all the used_2 of, let's say root_pool :
     58.10Gi
 +   21.00Ki
 +   85.44Mi
 +   37.64Mi
 +   7.29Gi
 +   1.14Gi
 + 648.50Ki
 + 964.50Ki
 + 692.50Ki
you will get approximatively what is actually taken by root_pool under used :
66.65Gi

And then if you configure correctly the xymon client & server, you will be able to get the graphics which will show you how your zfs FSs are changing by the time.
